# Story Exchange Response

#### Response
I really enjoy sites and places online where people can provide feedback to others on their work. I follow subreddits like r/writingprompts and r/redditserials where people write or post their writing and can receive feedback. I think having a site dedicated to this would be very useful. I'm also excited to work with Berkeley because we're good friends and we've already known each other for awhile now.

#### Contributions
I'm happy to help however I can. I have experience on the front and back end, so I can help wherever needed. We'll be working on a login page, http requests to the server, handling of those requests and interactions with the database(s). I'm excited to work on the project.

###### Business, Legal and Technical
I agree with Berkeley's thoughts in these areas for the project. Another thought I had for the business side is adding things like user follows, so that users could stay up to date on their favorite writers new works and help them with it. Also adding the ability for users to give their reviewers credit as a thank you or rating reviewers so that you can become a respected reviewer. For the technical, I also agree that the NoSQL graph based database would be a good option. Especially considering user connections and reviewer to reviewee connections.
